						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Something I learned from this article was that white space can be utilized in very unique forms. It is not just the empty space that it is often generalized into but can even be the space between text that we might look over. Everything often has a reason for why it was placed somewhere. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was when they talked about how not all white space needs to be used. I like how they mentioned that it can be a tool to not use the space to enhance the viewers direction and attention towards something else. Additionally, I like how they mentioned that it was a common misconception that designers and viewers face.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "white space is wasted space!" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
