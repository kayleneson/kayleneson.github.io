                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Though I don't think I necessarily "learned" anything from this article, I did enjoy seeing some of the UI that's out there. I thought that it was really cool to see how others thought of these designs and ways of interactions. Additionally, I thought that there must have been some research that also went behind the creation of these designs. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I would probably say the same thing as the first answer. My favorite part was trying to think about how these designers made these and what process it took them. It's interesting to see what could have been different from my point of view if I were the one to make it. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite design was the credit card index and sidebar by Arvin. I thought that this was one unique because of it's ability to show each credit card (like apple wallet) but also show the amount of money used/left in side that card as well. I loved how it was interactive yet also able to track the user's spending. By making the remaining amount of money visible, it helps the user to not spend as much money (imo lol).  </p>

                            <p> 8 because I liked being able to see the animations and different designs.</p>
