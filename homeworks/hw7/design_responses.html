							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that i learned from this article was the Closure principle in Gestalt psychology that suggests that people tend to perceive a complete shape or figure even when it's incomplete or parts of it are missing. In UI design, this principle can be used to create a sense of completeness and continuity in the user interface. One common application of the Closure principle in UI design is the use of icons or symbols. These simple shapes can be combined in a way that triggers the Closure principle in the user's mind, completing the overall shape or figure and conveying the intended meaning.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article were the visual examples that helped me to understand topics. My favorite ones were emergence, reification, and invariance. But of the three I would say I enjoyed reading and learning most about emergence.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?”
